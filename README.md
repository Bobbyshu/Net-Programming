This project is for refractoring the project I have finished in my CS5500 course.
The primitive project is a pixel-based game developed by Dlang featuring real-time chat functionality and player render for multiple user based on DUB.(with my three talented teammates!)
I Designed both client and server-side TCP communication modules using Socket programming techniques and integrated multi-thread for efficient game rendering and chat to enhance performance and interactivity.
Based on the prior project(https://github.com/Bobbyshu/Husky_Town), I developed this chat room by Java.
